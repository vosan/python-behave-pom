# walmart-python-pom
This is a demo POM (Page Object Model) automation framework website using Selenium, Python, and Behave as a BDD framework.
I decided to automate www.walmart.com as it contains JavaScript elements.

The goal of the framework is to be able to easily use business Gerkin language in .feature files and allow creating new steps as fast and easy as possible. The framework should be easy and intuitively understandable.
